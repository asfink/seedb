\section{{\large \VizRecDB\ } Execution Engine}
In this section, we discuss the design and implementation of the \VizRecDB\
Execution Engine. 
The input to the \VizRecDB\ engine is a set of view stubs (tripes of the form
$(a, m, f)$) and the output is the top-$k$ views with the highest utility.
The goals of the \VizRecDB\ engine are two fold:
(1) to efficienctly compute the utility of a large number of views, and (2) to accurately rank views in order of
utility to find the $k$ views with the highest utility.


As discussed in the architecture overview, we explored two distinct
implementations of the \VizRecDB\ execution engine.
Our first design implemented the \VizRecDB\ engine as a wrapper on top of a
vanilla database system.
We chose this design so that \VizRecDB\ could be used unchanged with a variety of
existing DBMSs.
Our goal was to study how far we could push existing systems to
support a \VizRecDB-type workload without making any changes to the underlying
DBMS.
Implemented as a wrapper over a DBMS, \VizRecDB\ is limited to using the API
exposed by the DBMS; essentially, \VizRecDB\ is limited to opening/closing connections to the
database and executing SQL queries. 
Since we have no control over how queries are executed or access to intermediate
results, {\it our optimizations minimize total execution time by minimizing the
total number of scans of the underlying table}.
We now discuss the basic framework used by \VizRecDB\ to query the DBMS and various
optimizations supported by \VizRecDB.

\subsection{Basic Framework}
\label{sec:basic_framework}
Given a set of view stubs provided to the execution engine, the basic framework
works as follows: 
(1) for each view, we generate SQL queries for the target and
comparison view (see queries in Section \ref{sec:problem_statement}), 
(2) we execute each view query independently on the DBMS, 
(3) the results of each query (i.e. aggregated values) are processed and
normalized to compute the target and comparison distributions, 
(4) we compute utility for each view and select the top-$k$ views with the largest utility.
If the underlying table has $d$ dimension attributes and $m$ measure attributes,
$2\ast d \ast m$ queries must be separately executed and their results
processed. Even for modest size tables (1M tuples, $d$=50, $m$=5), this
technique takes prohibitively long (700s on Postgres). The basic approach is
clearly inefficient since it examines every possible view and executes each view
query independently.

\subsection{Optimizations} 
\label{sec:dbms_optimizations}
As discussed above, the basic framework performs one scan of the table for each
query that is executed, causing {\it 2 * number of views} scans of the
underlying table. Since our goal is to minimize the number of scans, our ideal
operator $\mathcal{O}$ would perform a single scan of the data, compute all
$d*m$ group-bys and aggregates in one pass, and return only the top-$k$
views.
Current database systems do not support this functionality. 
The SQL GROUPING SETS\footnote{GROUPING SETS allow the simultaneous
  grouping of query results by multiple sets of attributes.} functionality
  available in a handful of systems can be used to support this operation;
  however, it is unclear how this operator will scale to large number of groups
  and as we show in Section \ref{sec:in_memory_execution_engine}, evaluating all
  views for the entire dataset is unnecessary and inefficient.

Without this ideal operator $\mathcal{O}$,
our optimizations minimize table scans in two ways: (1) minimize the total number of
queries by intelligently combining queries, and (2) reduce the total
execution time by running queries in parallel. \VizRecDB\ supports the following
optimizations and their combinations.

\subsubsection {Combine Multiple Aggregates} 
A large number of view queries have the same group-by attribute but different
aggregation attributes. 
Therefore, \VizRecDB\ combines all view queries with the same
group-by attribute into a single, combined view query. For instance, instead of executing
queries for views $(a_1$, $m_1$, $f_1)$, $(a_1$, $m_2$, $f_2)$ \ldots $(a_1$, $m_k$, $f_k)$
independently, we can combine the $n$ views into a single view represented by
$(a_1, \{m_1, m_2\ldots m_k\}$, $\{f_1, f_2\ldots f_k\})$. We demonstrate this
optimization offers a speed-up roughly linear in the number of measure
attributes.

\subsubsection {Combine Multiple Group-bys}
\label{subsec:mult_gb}
  Similar to the multiple aggregates optimization, another optimization
  supported by \VizRecDB\ is to combine queries with different group-by attributes
  into a single query with multiple group-bys attributes.
  For instance, instead of executing queries for views $(a_1$, $m_1$, $f_1)$,
  $(a_2$, $m_1$, $f_1)$ \ldots $(a_n$, $m_1$, $f_1)$ independently, we can
  combine the $n$ views into a single view represented by $(\{a_1, a_2\ldots
  a_n\}$, $m_1$, $f_1)$ and post-process results.

  While this optimization has the potential to significantly reduce query
  execution time, we find (Section \ref{sec:experiments}) that the time to
  execute a query with multiple group-by attributes depends on the number of distinct values
  present in the resulting combination of dimension attributes.
  This is expected because for a large number of distinct values, the query
  executor must keep track of a large number of aggregates. 
  This increases computational time (e.g. for sorting in sort-based aggregate)
  as well as temporary storage requirements (e.g. for hashing in hash-based
  aggregate), making this technique ineffective for large number of values.
  As a result, we must combine group-by attributes such that the number of
  distinct values remains {\it small enough}. 
  The upper limit on the number distinct values for a given combination of
  group-by attributes is given by the product of the number of distinct values
  for each attribute.
  For example, if we combine three dimension attributes $a_i$, $a_j$ and $a_k$
  with $n_i$, $n_j$ and $n_k$ values respectively, the maximum number of
  distinct groups is $n_i\ast n_j \ast n_k$.
 % The number of distinct groups in turn depends on the correlation between
 % values of attributes that are being grouped together. 
 % For instance, if two
 % dimension attributes $a_i$ and $a_j$ have $n_i$ and $n_j$ distinct values
 % respectively and a correlation coefficient of $c$, the number of distinct
 % groups when grouping by both $a_i$ and $a_j$ can be approximated by
 % $n_i$$\ast$$n_j$$\ast$(1-$c$) for $c$$\neq$1 and $n_i$ for $c$=1 ($n_i$ must
 % be equal to $n_j$ in this case).
  
  Therefore, our problem can be stated as follows:
  given a set of dimension attributes $A$ = \{$a_1$\ldots$a_n$\}, divide the
  dimension attributes in $A$ into groups $A_1$\ldots$A_l$ (where $A_i$ is some
  subset of $A$ and $\bigcap A_i$=$A$) such that the number of distinct values
  for each group is small. We designed two strategies to group dimension
  attributes.
  
  \begin{itemize} 
  \item {\bf Bin-packing}: In this trategy, we set an upper limit $V$ on the
  number of distinct groups that any combination of dimension attributes can
  produce.
  Now, suppose that each dimension attribute $a_i$ $\in A$ has $n_i$ distinct
  values.
  We cast the problem of finding the optimal grouping of dimension attributes as
  a version of bin-packing.
  Let each dimension attribute $a_i$ be an item with volume $log(n_i)$ and
  suppose that we are given bins of volume $log(V)$.
  Then finding the optimal grouping of attributes is exactly equivalent to
  finding the optimal packing of attribute items into the minimum number of
  bins.
  \item {\bf Incremental Grouping}: In this strategy, we do not set an
  explicit upper limit on the number of distinct groups. 
  Instead, we assume that
  we are given a black box function that given a particular grouping of
  attributes returns a value for the ``goodness'' of the combination. 
  For instance, in
  Section \ref{sec:analytical_model}, we develop an analytical model for the
  performance of the DBMS-backed Execution Engine. 
  This model predicts the execution time for the
  \VizRecDB\ engine and can be used in place of the black box function. 
  A simpler
  black box function maybe a combination of the maximum number of distinct
  values across all the groups and the number of groups. 
  Given a black box
  function, our heuristic works as follows: until the ``goodness'' of the
  grouping keeps increasing (or execution time keeps decreasing), repeat the
  following -- (1) sort the attribute groups in ascending order of number of
  distinct values, (2) combine the first two groups into a single group and
  calculate the number of distinct values for this new group.
\end{itemize} 
We experimentally evaluate both strategies in Section \ref{sec:experiments}.
 
\subsubsection{Combine target and comparison view query}
\label{subsec:target_comparison_view}
Since the target view and comparison views only differ in the subset of data
that the query is executed on, we can easily rewrite these two view queries as
one. For instance, for the target and comparison view queries $Q1$ and $Q2$
shown below, we can add a group by clause to combine the two queries into $Q3$.
\begin{align*} 
Q1 = &{\tt SELECT \ } a, f(m) \ \ {\tt FROM} \  D\  {\tt WHERE \ \ x\ <\ 10\
GROUP \ \ BY} \ a \\
Q2 = &{\tt SELECT \ } a, f(m) \ \ {\tt FROM} \  D\  {\tt GROUP \ \ BY} \ a \\
Q3 = &{\tt SELECT \ } a, f(m), {\tt CASE\ IF\ x\ <\ 10\ THEN\ 1\ ELSE\ 0\
END}\\ 
&as\ group1,\ 1\ as\ group2\\ 
&{\tt FROM} \ D\ {\tt GROUP \ \ BY} \ a,\ group1,\ group2
\end{align*}
This rewriting allows us to obtain results for both queries in a single table
scan. The impact of this optimization depends on the selectivity of the
input query and the presence of indexes. When the input query is less selective,
the query executor must do more work if the two queries are run separately. In
contrast, in the presence of an index, running selective queries independently
may be faster.

  \subsubsection {Parallel Query Execution}
  \label{subsec:parallel_exec}
  While the above optimizations reduce the number of queries executed, we can
  further speedup \VizRecDB\ processing by executing view queries in parallel. When
  executing queries in parallel, we expect co-executing queries to share pages in the
  buffer pool for scans of the same table, thus reducing disk accesses and
  therefore the total execution time. 
  However, a large number of parallel queries can lead to poor performance for
  several reasons including buffer pool contention, locking and cache line
  contention \cite{Postgres_wiki}. 
  As a result, we must identify the optimal number of parallel queries for our workload.
  
  % We do observe a reduction in the
  %overall latency when a small number of queries are executing in parallel;
  % however, the advantages disappear for larger number of queries running in
  % parallel. We discuss this further in the evaluation subsection.

 \subsubsection {Pre-computing Comparison Views}
  We notice that in the case where our comparison view is constructed from the
  entire underlying table (Example 1 in Section \ref{sec:introduction}),
  comparison views are the same irrespective of the input query.
  In this case, we can precompute all possible comparison views once and store
  them for use in all future comparisons. If the dataset has $a$ dimension and
  $m$ measure attributes, pre-computing comparison views would add $a$$\ast$$m$
  tables. This corresponds to an extra storage of $O(a\ast m \ast n)$ where $n$
  is the maximum number of distinct values in any of the $a$ attributes. 
  Note that pre-computation cannot be used in situations where the comparison
  view depends on the target view (Example 2) or is directly specified by the
  user (Example 3).
  
\subsubsection {Sampling}
  For large datasets, sampling can be used to significantly improve
  performance. To use sampling with \VizRecDB, we precompute a sample of the
  entire dataset (size of sample depends on desired accuracy). When a query is
  issued to \VizRecDB, we run all view queries against the sample and pick the
  top-k views. Only these high-utility views are then computed on the entire
  dataset. \\

\noindent{\bf Row Stores vs. Column Stores:}
Our DBMS-backed execution engine for \VizRecDB\ is agnostic towards the
particular DBMS used to execute queries. 
However, because of significant differences in the way that row stores and
column stores organize data, some of the above optimizations (e.g. combining a
large number of aggregates) will be more powerful in row stores and may actually
hurt performance in column stores. In our experimental evaluation (Section
\ref{sec:experiments}), we study the relative advantages of each of our
optimizations.
