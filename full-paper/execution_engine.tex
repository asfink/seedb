\section{{\large \SeeDB} Execution Engine}
\label{sec:optimizer}

As mentioned in the previous section, the \SeeDB execution engine is responsible for
evaluating the entire collection of potential visualizations and returning the top-$k$
visualizations in real-time.
To do so, it must apply aggressive optimization to minimize the number of queries to the
DBMS and avoid evaluation of low-utility views.
In addition to online sharing and pruning optimizations, discussed next, 
we describe additional offline precomputation as well as pruning techniques in our extended
technical report~\cite{seedb-tr}
