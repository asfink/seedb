\section{{\large \SeeDB} Execution Engine}
\label{sec:optimizer}

%As mentioned in the previous section, the \SeeDB execution engine is responsible for
%evaluating the entire collection of potential visualizations and returning the top-$k$
%visualizations in real-time.
In this setion, we describe the sharing and pruning optimizations designed
to optimize the generation of visualizations.
\papertext{In addition to these optimizations,
we describe additional offline precomputation as well as pruning techniques in our extended
technical report~\cite{seedb-tr}.}
