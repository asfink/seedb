\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

In this paper, we present \SeeDB, a system to automatically generate interesting
query visualizations based on metrics of deviation.
We present two implementations of \SeeDB, one as a wrapper on top of existing
DBMSs and another, a custom execution engine that supports shared table scans
and aggressive pruning.
We develop and evaluate a suite of optimizations for both implementations that
provides upwards of a 10X speedup.
Our experimental evaluation on a range of real and synthetic datasets shows that
our optimizations reduce latency from 500s to 20s for row stores and 100s to
10s.
Similarly, our experiments on the custom execution engine show that our pruning
heuristics can reduce latency 10-fold by aggresively pruning low-utility views.
This provides us a means to instantly surface the top few views and then
gradually return additional views.
Finally, we demonstrate that our pruning
strategies do not adversely affect accuracy of views returned.
