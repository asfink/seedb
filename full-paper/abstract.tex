Data analysts operating on large volumes of data often rely on visualizations to
interpret the results of queries.
However, finding the right visualization given a query of interest is a
laborious and time-consuming task.
We propose \VizRecDB, a system to partially automate this task:
given a query, \VizRecDB\ intelligently explores the space of all possible
visualizations, evaluates promising visualizations, and automatically recommends
the most ``interesting'' or ``useful'' visualizations to the analyst.
In this paper, we present two implementations of \VizRecDB\ which make very
different design choices: the first leverages existing database systems as the
backend and aggressively optimizes queries to get the highest performance; the
second is a proof-of-concept implementation that has been engineered from scratch and
without the constraints of the DBMS API, can overcome many of the limitations of
the first design.
For both implementations, we develop and evaluate a suite of optimizations that
leverage the underlying system properties.
Our experiments  on a range of real world and synthetic datasets demonstrate
that our optimizations speed up processing by up to 8-20X without sacrificing
much accuracy.
Our end-to-end experiments also demonstrate that that \VizRecDB\ can be used to
find interesting visualizations in interactive time scales.
Finally, we present the results of a user study that evaluates our method for
interesting visualizations, the relative quality of different distance metrics
and the \VizRecDB\ system.
